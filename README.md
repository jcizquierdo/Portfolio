# Portfolio

## I started my portfolio. While it doesn't look like much right now I hope to build on this website and make it look more professional to make myself employer competitive.

### I first sketched my webpage out on paper and did a pretty good job following the template. I used the css box model to position my sections and used the flex element to make my sections align with each other. Media queries and grid elements are yet to come, I need to practice some more in these coming days.
